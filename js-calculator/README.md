# [JavaScript Calculator](https://devlana.github.io/playground/js-calculator)

A user friendly calculator built with vanilla JavaScript. You can [follow this link](https://devlana.github.io/playground/js-calculator) to check it out.

It has many features some of which include taking the square root and percentages of numbers.

The calculator also has keyboard support.

A React version of the calculator that I built can also be found on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Ade_Lana/pen/RwNRgJa).
