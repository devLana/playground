# [Todo App](https://devlana.github.io/playground/todo-app/)

A todo app built with vanilla JavaScript. You can follow [this link](https://devlana.github.io/playground/todo-app/) to check out the live demo.

The todo app allows user to add, delete and edit todos.

The user can also mark a todo based on importance and also mark it as completed once they are done.

A React version of this todo app that I built can also be found [here](https://devlana-todo-app.netlify.app/).
