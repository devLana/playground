# [JavaScript Form Validator](https://devlana.github.io/playground/js-form-validator)

A simple client side [form validator](https://devlana.github.io/playground/js-form-validator) that checks user input for errors and ensures there aren't any before the form can be submitted.

The username and email fields are cross-checked against [users.json](https://devlana.github.io/playground/js-form-validator/users.json) which serves as a makeshift database record to ensure the values don't exist before they can be submitted with the form.
